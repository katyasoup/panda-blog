###Edinburgh Zoo is home to the only giant pandas in the UK. The female is called Tian Tian (Sweetie) and the male is Yang Guang (Sunshine). 

Both pandas have identical, but separate  enclosures as giant pandas are entirely solitary animals that only meet during breeding season once a year. 

The outdoor enclosures feature tree trunks for the pandas to scratch against and climb; large wooden climbing frames and tree houses; caves and ponds. 

Each panda also has an off show area where keepers weigh the pandas each morning, carrying out important daily training.
